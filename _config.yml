# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Asynchronous Circuit Design - Concepts
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"

  providing an intuitive method of specifying circuits. This blog explains concepts,
  from the basics to more complicated examples.
