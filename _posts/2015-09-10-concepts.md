Hello, and welcome to a series describing some of the more simple ideas
of my PhD research, based on designing asynchronous circuits using
*concepts*, an abstract language used to describe behaviours of
specifications at signal, gate and protocol levels.

Simply put, concepts
are a textual form of describing relationships between signal
transitions in a system.  They are *compositional* and thus, several
concepts can be composed to produce a new concept, which can then be
composed with other concepts and so on.

Concepts can be used to describe
smaller aspects of a system, such as *causal relationships*, *initial
states* and *quiescent transitions*. However, due to their
compositionality, they can be composed, and then used to describe *logic
gates* or *protocols* and the transitions which occur within these. This
removes the need to describe the signal interactions of gates and
protocols, which can be lengthy, and a gate or protocol can simply be
referred to by it's name and the signals it uses.

This series will be
used to discuss the design of logic gates using concepts.  Concepts are
described using various operators which have been defined in a Haskell
program, which serves as the backend for this method.  Any operators we
meet in during this series will be described.

A graphical front end,
[Workcraft](http://www.workcraft.org/),will eventually be used for
viewing *Signal Transition Graphs* (STGs) converted from concepts using
an algorithm, which will be described in these posts.

The following
posts in this series will begin by describing some simple gates,
explaining how concepts are used to describe them. Then, how these
are converted to produce an STG will be explained. Some other basic
ideas of concepts and the conversion process will also be explained, for
example, how initial states are applied, whether they are defined or not
as concepts.

Following the basics, some more complex gates will be
described, as well as how to make the descriptions of these gates
simpler. This will all start with the following post: [***Concepts I: A
