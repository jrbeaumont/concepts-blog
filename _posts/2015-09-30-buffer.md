A Buffer
--------

In this post, we will discuss one of the most simple logic gates, a *buffer*.

![Buffer schematic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer_schematic.svg)

A buffer takes an input signal, and outputs a signal in the same state as the
input signal, the output simply follows the input. For example, if the input
signal changes from 0 to 1, the output will eventually change from 0 to 1. We
say the output changes ‘eventually’ because the output changes after some
unknown delay. It is possible for the input to change from 0 to 1, and then
back to 0 very quickly, before we see any changes on the output. But
intuitively, we want to be able to say that if the input transitions from 0 to
1, then stays 1 long enough, the output will follow and also transition to 1.

So how can we design these using concepts? We need to describe the causal
relationship between the input and output; what occurs in the input to cause a
transition in the output? For a buffer, this is when a signal transition
occurs on the input, this needs to be reflected on the output.  This can be
described as:

{% highlight haskell %}
buffer a b = a+ ~> b+ <> a- ~> b-
{% endhighlight %}

There are some operators to discuss here:

`~>` - Shows the causal relationship

`<>`  - The composition operator

This concept therefore implies that `a+` causes `b+`, this is composed
with `a-` causing `b-`.  This covers all the operations of the buffer.

But now, how does this turn into a Signal Transition Graph, which we can
simulate, verify and test to ensure it works correctly? This is performed
using an algorithm:

![First step of buffer translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer0.svg)

First of all, the algorithm takes the list of concepts and finds places one of
these cycle for each individual signal. This is to keep with the property of
*consistency*, where positive (`+`) and negative (`-`) transitions of each
signal must always alternate. This is also a-keeping with the possibility for
a signal to transition one way and back quickly withb affecting the others,
as with the example of the input transitioning high and then low before the
output changes.

![Second step of buffer translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer1.svg)

Next, the algorithm uses the first concept, `a+ ~> b+`, to show this
causality in the STG. This concept shows how the input rising causes the
output to rise, so this is viewed in an STG by connecting the `a_1` place,
which shows when the input has transitioned high, to the transition of
`b+`. This is done using an arc commonly known as a read-arc. This is
because a one way arc connecting these STG components would mean that when
`b+` occurs, a token in `a_1` is consumed, blocking `a-` from being
enabled. A read-arc allows `b+` to simply check for a token in `a_1`
for it to occur withb consuming it.

![Final step of buffer translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer2.svg)

In the final step for designing a buffer, another read arc is used which
represents the concept of `a- ~> b-`, connecting `a_0` place with the
`b-` transition. This conversion of a concept to an STG is now complete.

Note that in the above STGs we assume that all signals are initialised to 0. 
In a later blog post we will see how to use concepts to specify initial states
of all signals in a compositional manner.

Reuse
-----

Now we have defined a buffer, we can reuse this. As said earlier in this post,
a concept can be defined as several concepts. Therefore, let use an example of
a circuit which uses buffers.

![Schematic of a double buffer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/double-buffer_schematic.svg)

This circuit can be produced from the following concept:

{% highlight haskell %}
doubleBuffer = buffer a b <> buffer b c
{% endhighlight %}

In this circuit, `a` is an input, `c` is an output, and `b` is an internal
signal connecting the output of `buffer_1` to the input of `buffer_2`. We
could have described this using signal-level concepts, which would be a longer
description that that of the one above. Since we have defined a buffer, we can
simply reuse this definition in order to save time on describing concepts.
This produces the following Signal Transition Graph:

![Double buffer STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/double-buffer_STG.svg)

Comparing this STG to the STG for a single buffer, it is possible to see that
`a` and `b` in this STG form one buffer, and `b` and `c` form another buffer. 
Again, we assume that all signals are initially 0.

Finally
-------

In this first blog post, we have discussed how to describe a simple logic
gate, a buffer, in terms of concepts. How these concepts are then converted
into a Signal Transition Graph is also described. Another useful aspect of
concepts is their reusability, and how a defined concept can be reused is
displayed in an example using two buffers.

The concepts described here can be used with the concepts translation tool,
available from <https://github.com/tuura/concepts>, or with this tool
integrated with [Workcraft](http://www.workcraft.org/), for the ability to
visualise the translated STGs.

The following post, [***Concepts II: An inverter***]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/10/21/inverter.html) will discuss another simple
logic gate, an inverter. After having defined these two gates, a further post
will explain how initial states work, whether defined as part of a concept or
not, using both a buffer and an inverter as examples.
