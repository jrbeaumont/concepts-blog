An inverter
-----------

In the second post in the *Concepts* series we will discuss another simple
logic gate, an *inverter*.

![Inverter schematic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/inverter_schematic.svg)

An inverter takes an input signal, and outputs a signal in the opposite, or
inverted, state as the input signal, the output is simply the opposite of the
input. For example, if the input signal changes from 0 to 1, the output will
eventually change from 1 to 0. Similar to with the buffer, and the same with
all gates, we say the output changes ‘eventually’ because the output changes
after some unknown delay.

So how do we design an inverter using concepts? We need to describe what
causes the output to transition, in terms of when the input transitions. 
This can be described as:

{% highlight haskell %}
inverter a b = a+ ~> b- <> a- ~> b+
{% endhighlight %}

This is very similar to the buffer concept, but with some subtle differences. 
This concept implies that `a+` causes `b-`.  This is composed with `a-`
causing `b+`.  Therefore, this concept suggest that when the input
transitions one way, the output will eventually transition in the opposite
direction, for example, when `a+` occurs, `b-` will eventually occur after,
providing `a` stays `high`.

As with the [previous post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/
09/30/buffer.html), we need to produce an STG from the inverter concept, which
we can simulate, verify and test.  To do this, we pass this into the
conversion algorithm, which starts as follows:

![First step of inveter translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer0.svg)

As with the buffer, it starts off by placing cycles for each individual
signal.  This keeps the property of consistency in the STG, as discussed in
[*Concepts I*]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/09/30/buffer.html).

![Second step of inveter translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/inverter1.svg)

Next, the first causality of the inverter concept is applied to these cycles. 
This is `a+ ~> b-`. This connects the place after `a+`, labelled as `a_1`,
with the signal transition of `b-`, using a *read-arc*. This is so that for
`b-` to occur, `a` must have already transitioned `high`, which is
displayed by `a_1` possessing a token. The read-arc stops `b-` from
consuming the token in `a_1` which would block `a-` from happening, but
allows `b-` to occur.

![Final step of inveter translation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/inverter2.svg)

Finally, another read arc is used which represents the concept of `a- ~> b+`
, connecting `a_0` place with the `b+` transition. This conversion of a
concept to an STG is now complete, and this correctly represents the operation
of an inverter.

Note, as with the buffer STG, that in the above STGs we assume that all
signals are initialised to 0.  In this case, it means that the output can
initially transition *high* and will do eventually, due to the fact that in
input is initially `0`.

In a later blog post we will see how to use concepts to specify initial states
of all signals in a compositional manner.

More reuse
----------

We have now defined both an inverter and a buffer in these first two posts.
So lets use these together to show some reuse, and how these can be used
together.

For this example, lets use a buffer and inverter loop.  It doesn't necessarily
have any real-world applications as these logic gates, but it's a perfect
example to show how concepts can be composed, and produces some interesting
results.

![A buffer-inverter loop schematic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer-inverter_schematic.svg)

The signals shown in this diagram are simply used for viewing the outputs from
the inverter and the buffer, but can be used as part of the concepts.

This circuit can be produced from the following concept:

{% highlight haskell %}
bufferAndInverter = buffer a b <> inverter b a
{% endhighlight %}

In this circuit, `a` is an input to the buffer, but the output from the
inverter, and these are connected.  `b` is another signal connecting the
output of the `buffer` to the input of the `inverter`.

As with the `doubleBuffer` example from the previous post, we could have
described this using signal-level concepts, which would be a longer
description that that of the one above. Since we have defined both an inverter
and a buffer, we can simply reuse this definition in order to save time on
describing concepts. The `bufferAndInverter` STG will be, assuming all signals
are initially 0, as follows:

![Translated STG of a buffer-inverter loop]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/buffer-inverter_STG.svg)

By following pairs of arcs, it is possible to see which are a cause of the
buffer, and which are a cause of the inverter.  This STG can now be simulated,
and does in fact act as expected from the circuit above.  When `a+` occurs,
`b+` is enabled,  and after it transitions, this will cause `a-` to be
enabled.  When `a-` has occurred, `b-` can then occur, after which `a+` is
enabled, and this completes the circuit.

This STG can be resynthesized, and the result is rather interesting:

![Resynthesized buffer-inverter loop -- A handshake]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/handshake1.svg)

The resulting STG is in-fact the STG for a *handshake* protocol.  This means
that what we have defined above, `bufferAndInverter`, is actually a `handshake`
, described using a buffer and an inverter.  Therefore, let's drop the current
name, and re-define it using some parameters, so that any pair of signals can
be handshaked.

{% highlight haskell %}
handshake a b  = buffer a b <> inverter b a
{% endhighlight %}

Handshakes are very useful for asynchronous systems, and having a concept
defined for use at any time can make the design process much easier and
quicker.

Finally
-------

In this post, we have discussed how to describe a second logic gate, an
inverter. We have described this in terms of concepts, and shown the
conversion to produce an STG. We have also shown how a buffer and an inverter
can be used in conjunction with one-another to produce a circuit, now that
both have been pre-defined.

The next post, [***Concepts III: Initial States***]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/) will use buffers and inverters as examples of how initial
states can be defined using concepts, or in the case that initial states are
not defined, how the conversion algorithm will apply options for initial
states, so an STG produced can still be used for simulation.
