C-Element
---------

Finally, after introducing the basics of concepts, we can now apply this to
the design of logic gates. In this post, we will produce a very standard gate,
a *C-Element*.

A C-Element's basic operation is that, when all the inputs to the gate are
high, or 1, then the output will be set high. This output will remain high
until all of the inputs are low, or 0, at which point the output will be set
low.

So let's describe this using concepts!

Concepts
--------

For this example, the C-Element we describe will be a 2 input gate. These will
be `a` and `b`.  The single output will be `c`.

So let's start with describing what causes the output to go high:

{% highlight haskell %}
outputRise =  a+ ~> c+ <> b+ ~> c+
{% endhighlight %}

This concept will cause the output, `c`, to go high when both the inputs, `a`
and `b`, are high.

Next, let's describe what causes the output to go low:

{% highlight haskell %}
outputFall =  a- ~> c- <> b- ~> c-
{% endhighlight %}

Similar to the previous concept, `outputFall` will cause `c` to go low only
when both `a` and `b` are low.

And these two concepts describe the operation of a C-element. Let's combine
them, and then we can Convert them to an STG, giving us the following:

{% highlight haskell %}
CElement = outputRise <> outputFall
{% endhighlight %}

![Translated STG of a C-element]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element1.svg)

In this state however, this STG is not particularly useful, as there are no
initial states, and therefore it cannot be simulated or synthesized. Thus,
let's add an initial state concept:

{% highlight haskell %}
initialState = initialise a 0 <> initialise b 0 <> initialise c 0
CElement  = outputRise <> outputFall <> initialState
{% endhighlight %}

By setting all the initial states to 0, we can then test this STG using
Workcraft, and see that the STG (shown below) operates as a C-element.

![Translated STG of a C-element with initial states]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element2.svg)

This STG could also be tested by setting the initial states to any combination. The C-Element would still act as expected.

Some reuse
----------

It is possible to describe a C-Element using predefined gates. If we break
down some of the concepts used above we find some interesting points.

If we take the interactions of just one input signal and the output signal
from the above concepts we get the following:

{% highlight haskell %}
input1 = a+ ~> c+ <> a- ~> c-
{% endhighlight %}

This concept is actually exactly the same as a gate we have previously
defined:
[a buffer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/09/30/buffer.html).
Thus, a C-Element can actually be described using these:

{% highlight haskell %}
CElement = buffer a b <> buffer b c <> initialState
{% endhighlight %}

The initial state must be included in order for the resulting STG to be usable
in further operations.

Finally
-------

This blog post has finally explained how concepts can be used to design a
logic gate, albeit a simple one. This includes describing it's operations in
terms of the interactions of the input and output signals, or using
predefined concepts, particularly a buffer.

As with the previous posts, the concepts in this post can be used
with the concepts tool, available from
<https://github.com/tuura/concepts>, or using the built in concepts tool within
[Workcraft](http://workcraft.org).

In this post we have used signal transitions as `a+` and `a-`. The concepts
tool doesn't support postfix notation, so `a+` and `a-` must be replaced by
`rise a` and `fall a` to be used with the tool.

The next post will continue in the effort to define logic gates using
behavioural concepts, the next being a [***Set-Reset Latch***]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2016/07/05/set-reset-latch.html).
