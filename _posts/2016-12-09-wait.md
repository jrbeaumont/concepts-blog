WAIT element
------------

The posts from this series so far have discussed some standard gates,
such as
[buffers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/09/30/buffer.html),
[inverters]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2015/10/21/inverter.html)
,
[AND-/OR-gates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2016/08/05/or-causality-1.html)
and
[C-elements]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2016/01/13/c-element.html),
as well as discussing the concepts translation tool, and various concepts
required for this.

Now, we can discuss some slightly more complicated devices which can be
specified using concepts. In this post, it will be a *WAIT element*.

Background
----------

Asynchronous circuits are used to work in conjunction with circuits whose
signals may be *non-persistent*. This means that they may switch from high to
low and back quickly, and at non-regular intervals.

The problem with this is that it is not garunteed that an input signal
transition can cause an effect transition, a signal transition depending on
this input, to transition immediately, and sometimes, we may not be interested
in the state of this signal at a certain point, and we want to stop this
signal causing changes in the asynchronous circuit until it is necessary.

This is where the WAIT element comes in. This allows us to do two things:

1. Filter a non-persistant input signal in or out, depending on when we are
interested in its state.

2. When we are interested in it's state, we can wait for it to transition
high and latch this, capturing it and passing it into the asynchronous circuit as a persistant signal.

So how do we do that?

WAIT specification
------------------

![WAIT element schematic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/circuit-WAIT-box.svg)

This is the symbol for a WAIT element. There are three sigals involved:

`sig` - This is the input signal, a non-persistant signal, which we may want
to filter, or to capture.

`san` - The output signal, which is persistant.

`ctrl` - Is another input which determines what mode the element is in. *High*
will mean that it is in *WAIT mode*, awaiting `sig` going high, which will set
`san` high in this mode, latching this. *Low* means that it is in dormant
mode. It enters this state after `san` goes high, and this blocks changes in `
sig` from affecting this circuit.

Immediatley from this information, we can define the interface:

{% highlight haskell %}
interface = inputs [sig, ctrl] <> outputs [san]
{% endhighlight %}

Next, let's discuss their interactions. As said in the signal descriptions, as
soon as `sig` goes high, `san` is set high. We can describe this in concepts
as:

{% highlight haskell %}
outputHigh = sig+ ~> san+
{% endhighlight %}

What about the mode? Well, as stated, for `san` to go high, `sig` must be
high, and the element must be in WAIT mode, or when `ctrl` is high. Once `san`
does go high, the element enters dormant mode, so `ctrl` becomes low.
Following the access to the resource being used, `san` will go low once again,
allowing the element to enter WAIT mode once again. In concepts, this can be:

{% highlight haskell %}
modeSelect = ctrl+ ~> san+ <> san+ ~> ctrl- <> ctrl- ~> san- <> san- ~>ctrl+
{% endhighlight %}

You may recognise the patter of this concepts, it is infact a Handshake. Thus
we can reuse the pre-defined Handshake concept instead of this:

{% highlight haskell %}
modeSelect = handshake ctrl san
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we need to thin of initial states. Since we are awaiting `sig` to go
high, we can safely state that this will initially be low. Since `san` follows
`sig` as soon as it is detected to be high, we can also assume `san` is
initially low. The WAIT element itself should start in the dormant mode, until
resources start getting access requests so we can also state that `ctrl` is
initially low:

{% highlight haskell %}
initial = initialise0 [sig, san, ctrl]
{% endhighlight %}

So let's compile these concepts for a single specification, to be translated
by the [tool](https://github.com/tuura/concepts):

{% highlight haskell %}
waitElement sig san ctrl = outputHigh <> modeSelect <> interface <> initial
	where
		outputHigh = sig+ ~> san+
		modeSelect = handshake ctrl san
		interface = inputs [sig, ctrl] <> outputs [san]
		initial = initialise0 [sig, san, ctrl]
{% endhighlight %}

Translated, we find the following STG:

![translated WAIT element STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WAIT-stg.svg)

This isn't too revealing, but simulations prove that it works as expected.
Let's resynthesize it and find a nicer layout.

![resynthesized translated WAIT element STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/WAIT-stg-resynth.svg)

This reveals exactly how we discussed the design, with the handshake and the
`sig` and `san` interaction.

A note
------

This STG will not necessarily verify correctly. Ideally, when `ctrl` is high,
and the input, `sig`, goes high, `san` will immediatley go high. Only after
this however, will `sig` go low. However, because `sig` is non-persistant,
this means that `sig` can go high, and then low again before `san` transitions
high. Realistically, there is some delay for `san` to transition, which means
it may miss the change in `sig`

To fix this issue, we add a *dummy* transition. A dummy transition is not
related to a signal, but can be used to show the low to high transition of
`sig`, giving `san` time to transition. This gives us the following STG:

![WAIT element STG with dummy signal]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/stg-WAIT.svg)

&epsilon; is the dummy transition here. When `sig+` occurs, it will cause this
transition to occur, and then `san+` can occur following this, after the delay.

Dummy transitions are not yet implemented in the
[tool](https://github.com/tuura/concepts), but can be implemented in future.

Finally
-------

This post has featured an entirely different gate to those we have used before,
but using the same concepts we have been using all along. What's more is this
can be included in the tool as a standard, and it's been designed quite
easily.

Concepts are proving to make specifying the behaviours of  many different
gates and scenarios with differing uses simple, when broken down into a set of
simple to understand concepts based on signal-, protocol- or gate-level
concepts, allowing users to choose how they like to think of the designs, and
work in this way.

Next up, a related gate, the WAITX element. This takes the WAIT element and
provides some greater functions.

These can be tried in the tool, availble from
<https://github.com/tuura/concepts>, and also built into
[Workcraft](http://workcraft.org). The concepts given in these posts will work
with the tool, with one change. We use `a+` and `a-` in these posts for
clarity, however, the tool is written in Haskell, which does not support
post-fix notation. Therefore, when referring to signal transitions, please use
`rise a` and `fall a` for high and low transitions respectively.
