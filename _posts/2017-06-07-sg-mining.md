Experiment
----------

This blog primarily discusses new types of concepts, and new ways to use
concepts, detailing the existing library of concepts, as well as how users can
write their own concepts.

What if someone wants to use an existing design in their concept specification,
however? They may have to manually convert the design, in STG or FSM form for
example, to a concept specification, which may be a time consuming process.

To address this, we are experimenting with process-mining, and using this to
find behaviours that can be described as concepts.

Background
----------

Process-mining is a field which has multiple applications, for example, looking
at the real world processes that occur in a business. Information provided
for this consists of lists of events of the process in question. This will
consist of many lists, each detailing a different instance of this process,
with the events in the order they occured in this instance. Each event may
occur in a different order in each instance, and listing all of these different
event orders leads to something called an *event log*.

Process-mining takes these event-logs, and finds various points of interest
that can reveal various points about the process. This could be problem areas,
where for example, one event tends to always occur last, when it could occur
much earlier. The idea of this is finding methods of improving the process for
higher efficiency, for reduced costs, quicker process times and so on.

Process-mining with specifications
----------------------------------

For this experiment, we are interested in the order of events that occur in a
specification for an asynchronous system. In this case, the events are signal
transitions, and the event logs are lists of the possible orders these signal
transitions can occur in the system.

These event logs can be generated from any specification by looking at the
*state graph* of this system, the graph which shows what possible signal
transitions are possible when in any state. A state graph can be generated for
nearly any system, and this is why we use these to mine.

We use a tool, [*pgminer*](https://github.com/tuura/process-mining) to
automatically find concurrency in these event logs, which can help us find
concepts.

C-element example
-----------------

![C-element gate]({{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element-circuit.svg)

We will start off with a simple example, a C-element. We have discussed the
specification of a C-element [in this blog before]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2016/01/13/c-element.html)
but now we need to imagine that we have got a C-element specification, for
example an STG, but no concept specification.

An STG for a C-element could be as follows:

![C-element STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element-stg.svg)

And the state graph for this:

![C-element state graph]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element-fst.svg)

Now, from the initial state, we can see that either `a+` or `b+` can occur, and
this is important. This format shows the possible transitions at any time. Now
we need to convert this to an event log.

This specification does state that for signals `a` and `b` to fall, `c` must have
risen already, but this is done for clarity in the STG. If we were to test the
C-element gate itself, we would find that there is no baring on the input from
the output. With that said, we can produce the following event log:

{% highlight haskell %}
a+ b+ c+
b+ a+ c+
a- b- c-
b- a- c-
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the first two lines are the *set-phase* of the C-element, what is
required to set the output high, and the last two lines are the *reset-phase*.
Each of the phases contains both possible orders of the signals `a` and `b`.

This event log can then be passed into pgminer. pgminer is integrated as a
back-end tool for [Workcraft](http://workcraft.org), and can take an event log
such as this, and produce a Conditional Partial Order Graph (CPOG), which can
visualise the results, which will be a list of all possible events, with arcs
to show possible orderings. The resulting CPOG from pgminer will be as follows:

![C-element mined]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/c-element-mined.svg)

This gives us two separate objects, one showing `a+` and `b+` directing to `c+`
, and one showing `a-` and `b-` directing to `c-`. These can be identified
as separate concepts:

{% highlight haskell %}
outputRise = rise a ~> rise c <> rise b ~> rise c
outputFall = fall a ~> fall c <> fall b ~> fall c
{% endhighlight %}

And this is the specification of a C-element, as we know from the
[post on C-elements]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/2016/01/13/c-element.html).

Buck example
------------

We will now take three scenarios of an asynchronous buck controller, used to
regulate the voltage in a circuit. We will not discuss the ins and outs of the
operation of this, but we will state that there are three scenarios, one for
each operating mode of the buck. We will mine each one separatley.

First of all, we have the *zc absent* scenario. The STG for this is as follows:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcAbsent-stg.svg)

Notice this is a loop. In this case we will consider all possible traces of
events that return the system to the initial state, which in this case is
before `uv+`.

The state graph for this STG is:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcAbsent-fst.svg)

Note that it looks similar, there are no intracicies in the possible orders of
transitions. If we simulate this, trying to find all possible orders of
events, we will find the following event log will be produced.

{% highlight haskell %}
uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc- gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
{% endhighlight %}

This is to be expected, as the above STG has one path from the initial state
and back to this state. Similarly, mining this with pgminer will produce the
following CPOG:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcAbsent-mined.svg)

This is completely flat, with no choices or joins etc, so there is no interesting
concepts to be found from this. We can simply create the following concept:

{% highlight haskell %}
zcAbsent = rise uv ~> fall gn     <> fall gn ~> fall gn_ack
        <> fall gn_ack ~> rise gp <> rise gp ~> rise gp_ack
        <> rise gp_ack ~> fall uv <> fall uv ~> rise oc
        <> rise oc ~> fall gp     <> fall gp ~> fall gp_ack
        <> fall gp_ack ~> rise gn <> rise gn ~> rise gn_ack
        <> rise gn_ack ~> fall oc <> fall oc ~> rise uv
{% endhighlight %}

This is quite a long specifiation, but it captures the behaviours we detected
from mining the event log for this scenario, that is, that each signal
transition directly causes another.

Now lets move onto the *zc late* scenario, which is a little more interesting
to mine. The STG for this is:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcLate-stg.svg)

This features some concurrency, and some interesting interactions, detailed
in the state graph:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcLate-fst.svg)

This shows that after `uv+`, `zc+` and `zc-` will occur in that order at any
point before `uv-`. This means, the state graph encompasses every possible
order of these signal transitions. The event log for this scenario therefore
is as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
uv+ zc+ zc- gn- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ zc+ gn- zc- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ zc+ gn- gn_ack- zc- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ zc+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ zc+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- zc+ zc- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- zc+ gn_ack- zc- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- zc+ gn_ack- gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- zc+ gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- zc+ zc- gp+ gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- zc+ gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- zc+ gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ zc+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ zc+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ zc+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
{% endhighlight %}

This is long, but ultimatley accounts for every possible order of events.
If we mine this, however, we find the following CPOG:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcLate-mined.svg)

This image shows the same concurrency with `zc` as in the STG, but also shows
us how we can describe this in concepts:

{% highlight haskell %}
zcLate = uvReact <> fallUV
      <> fall gn ~> fall gn_ack <> fall gn_ack ~> rise gp
      <> rise gp ~> rise gp_ack <> fall uv ~> rise oc
      <> rise oc ~> fall gp     <> fall gp ~> fall gp_ack
      <> fall gp_acl ~> rise gn <> rise gn ~> rise gn_ack
      <> rise gn_ack ~> fall oc <> fall oc ~> rise uv
  where
    uvReact = rise uv ~> fall gn     <> rise uv ~> rise zc
    fallUV  = rise gp_ack ~> fall uv <> fall zc ~> fall uv
{% endhighlight %}

Here, the concurrency showed with `zc` and the other branch can be captured in
concepts, leading to `uvReact` and `fallUV`. The other concepts can be found
as just simple causalities once again.

The final scenario is *zc early*, which has some differences, and a bit more
concurrency. The STG is:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcEarly-stg.svg)

Note that `zc+` occurs before `uv+` in this, and that `uv+` occuring will only
then allow `gp+`. The state graph for zc early is as follows:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcEarly-fst.svg)

This indicates that `uv` may rise any time after `zc+`, but `gp+` cannot occur
until after `uv+`. Following `gp+`, `zc-` must occur before `uv-` can occur,
but this can happen at anytime, before or after `gp_ack+`.

All of the concurrency leads to the following event log for this scenario:

{% highlight haskell %}
zc+ gn- gn_ack- uv+ gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
zc+ gn- uv+ gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
zc+ uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ gp_ack+ zc- uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
zc+ gn- gn_ack- uv+ gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
zc+ gn- uv+ gn_ack- gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
zc+ uv+ gn- gn_ack- gp+ zc- gp_ack+ uv- oc+ gp- gp_ack- gn+ gn_ack+ oc-
{% endhighlight %}

Mining this will provide us with another CPOG, with similar layouts to the STG:

![zcAbsent scenario STG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zcEarly-mined.svg)

But this leads us to another specification:

{% highlight haskell %}
zcLate = zcReact <> gpRise <> fallUV
      <> fall gn ~> fall gn_ack <> rise gp ~> rise gp_ack
      <> fall uv ~> rise oc     <> rise oc ~> fall gp
      <> fall gp ~> fall gp_ack <> fall gp_acl ~> rise gn
      <> rise gn ~> rise gn_ack <> rise gn_ack ~> fall oc
      <> fall oc ~> rise zc
  where
    zcReact = rise zc ~> fall gn     <> rise zc ~> rise uv
    gpRise  = fall gn_ack ~> rise gp <> rise uv ~> rise gp
    fallUV  = rise gp_ack ~> fall uv <> fall zc ~> fall uv
{% endhighlight %}

Still, a long specification, but it encompasses all the reactions we can find
from the mined state graph.

Finally
-------

We find that we can mine event logs generated from state graphs in order to
find a concept specification, but this method is in its infancy. We are yet to
determine if there are any limitations to this, or the possible scope.

The concept specifications that this produces may not encompass some useful
interactions, such as handshakes or mutual exclusion, but the concepts should
still produce a viable STG for further use, verification and synthesis.

The specifications produced are also reasonably long, and we are also working
on a method of taking a specification produced from this method, and optimising
it, finding higher-level concepts which can replace some. This may or may not
reveal to a reader some interesting interactions, and for some concepts like
a handshake, which may not be revealed obviously, some embelishment with
transitive concepts may be useful to help produce a more optimised, or at least
more easily understood concept specification.

We will continue the experiment, aiming to find a way to automate this process and
allow existing designs to be used along with concepts.
